  V2.1.1, What changed:
  
  - Updated installer/updater to exclude operation if the logoff was selected.
  - Relocated code that was disabling a properly formatted/named Image Handler 4 image to allow IH4 and
  zen colorbox to continue to operate together.
  - Completed the incorporation of the code template code to minimize code rewriting/retyping. This also
  removed a javascript error that was generated on the checkout_payment page.
  - Incorporate ZC 1.5.5 code into the includes/modules/YOUR_TEMPLATE/additional_images.php file including
  notifiers and the comments at the top of the file.
  - Removed the obsolete language="javascript" parameters from the HTML <script> tags.
